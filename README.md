## Planting Flowers
I created my interactive artwork by connecting openframeworks with Arduino. In Arduino, I set up two switches that trigger two different visual effects in openframeworks. Using the ofNoise function in openframeworks, I drew a garden scene with grass and flowers. By toggling the switches, different colored flowers can be added to the grass. I also used ofNoise to create fireflies in the night, adding to the serene atmosphere of the piece.
